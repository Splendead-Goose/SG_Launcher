Goose's Legacy Game Launcher

Just a few wrappers to launch legacy games. Special Thanks to the GZDoom and eduke32 Teams for keeping these games alive!

Each game folder will just need their respective game files (not included) and their respective engines.

Pop some mods into the mod folders, and enjoy!
